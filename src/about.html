                    <h2>How it works?</h2>
                    <p>Podcasts can be produced independently or through a traditional media outlet. To form and release a podcast, one must first create audio or video content that meets the user's desired goal. The content should then be edited and formatted for optimal quality and performance on various digital platforms. After that, the podcast should be uploaded to hosting websites such as iTunes, Spotify, YouTube, or any other web streaming service according to its target audience. Once the host uploads an episode of the podcast it will immediately become available to any user subscribed to the appropriate channel. Podcast episodes should also be promoted through channels such as social media and blog posts to reach potential listeners and boost engagement.</p>
